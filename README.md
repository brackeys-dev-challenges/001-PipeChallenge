# Challenge #1 (23 May 2020)
## Recreate Super Mario Pipes
---

Here's a quick breakdown of some steps involved:

 - Switch scenes when player interacts with a pipe
 - Spawn player in front of the proper exit pipe
 - Add animation for entering and exiting the pipe
 - Add fade out and expanding circle when switching scene like in new Mario Maker 2
 - Bonus: Add coin collecting with counter persisting through scenes
 - Bonus 2: Only spawn coins if they haven't already been collected
 - Artistic Bonus: Make it prettier; add animations, moving clouds and so on

This starter project includes two scenes, as well as a character controller (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwcT-Dch0bA). The project was made in Unity 2019.3.13f - opening the project in any other version may break stuff (though anything 2019.3 should be fine)!
